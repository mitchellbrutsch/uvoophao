This is so unfair. Microsoft now owns mojang and the Lumia which is a Microsoft branded phone should be getting as much support as any other version on ios and android. I've been waiting now for 5 days to finally receive the 1.0 update. mcpe should be updated on windows phone frequently as the others get it and heck if it's a different process just put the windows 10 edition on mobile. I've literally looked at the specs for the game and a lumia can handle it. It's a port of mcpe after all right. Minecraft for Windows 10 Mobile.

I am returning to minecraft and just discovered I had a code for free windows 10 edition. I also heard something about a "better together" update or something like that, that allowed multiple platforms to play with eachother. But when I saw it was only for bedrock edition I was a bit dissapointed. All my saves are in java, and I never played bedrock (except for an old version of minecraft PE). Also all my friends play mobile. Are there any other advantages in bedrock, besides cross platform. This new edition finally gives Minecraft players on Windows 10 Mobile all the features players know and love: Realms, The End, Texture Packs, Add-Ons Hello all, recently I thought I'd try Minecraft bedrock edition for a week to see what it's like on the "other side". When I first got into Minecraft, I played PE 100% of the time, starting from 0.7.0 and going all the way to 0.13.0 before I got a decent computer and decided I wanted the full MC experience (at the time, PE was lacking so many features compared to Java). I was heavily invested in pocket edition, and as a beta tester I kept coming back for 0.14, 0.15, and 0.16 until I deleted. –ü–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ Windows 10 Mobile, —Ä–∞–Ω–µ–µ –∫—É–ø–∏–≤—à–∏–µ Minecraft Pocket Edition –Ω–∞ Windows Phone, –º–æ–≥—É—Ç —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å –æ–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ.

###Welcome to /r/MinecraftPE! ---------------- /r/MinecraftPE is the subreddit for the Pocket Edition of Minecraft , a game first released on PC in 2009, and released in Pocket Edition format in 2011. ---------- ###What is Minecraft? Minecraft is a game centered around creating and crafting. Obtaining resources, then using those resources to create items or create place-able blocks. It follows the 'samdbox' approach of gameplay, where the player can do what they want. From exploring.

I'm playing Minecraft Pocket Edition with my cousin (local MP), and I've been running into an irritating issue in which I can't transfer a stack of items. Mind you, I haven't played PE for a little while. Say. Since there was some announcement that there won't be any updates for the Windows Mobile platform. I since got an Android phone and repurchased MCPE. Now, I recall that you just had to to hold down an item that you want to transfer until the green bar shows roughly the percent. Fala galera blz?

Can we stop a second. Windows Phone, or rather, Windows 10 Mobile (as will be the case here), fans have been causing a bit of a stir this weekend ever since Mojang announced an all-new Windows 10 Edition of Minecraft. Since people have figured out how the minecraft server api works so well, and created things like Minechat as a client and Spigot/Bukkit as servers, why can't we either make a server that connects to a PC server and converts data before sending to PE (I know, it'd be inefficient, but it'd probably work) or make an entire client out of minechat? If the first method (convert to pe live), we could replace PC-exclusive blocks with the 'update game' blocks, or maybe bedrock or something, and entities.

Upgrade for Windows Phone players!  We stopped shipping Minecraft updates for Windows Phone 8 back in October last year.  If you were already running Windows 10 Mobile but playing the Windows Phone 8 version of Pocket Edition. Currently a problem with Minecraft PE on mobile devices is that there is no way to easily backup your worlds without file system access, a computer, or a separate app. Sharing your worlds via email isn‚Äôt very easy either. A solution to this would be adding an export option to selected content in the Storage menu in Settings. When share was clicked, the content would be packaged into a mcpack/.mcworld file, and a share sheet (if on mobile) would appear where the file could be opened in other.

I'm wondering if I should leave it running 8.1, or upgrade it to 10? This is an older phone, so finding recent info has been difficult. I primarily want to use it as a camera. I'm still using a Canon Digital Rebel, so don't mind older technology. I will have a data sim in it, and might even use it as my main phone for a while. Are people who upgraded to Windows 10 having any major issues? I've read some people state the battery drains twice as fast, but they are old comments and refere.

As anyone reading the front page of /r/Minecraft today knows, the big news of the day is the Better Together Update (https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/all-news-e3), which will "unify console, mobile and Windows 10 versions of the game under a single edition", allowing for cross-platform play: gt So going forward, the edition you'll find on Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, mobile and VR will simply be known as 'Minecraft', a separate entity from 'Minecraft: Java Edition', which is the original. –ê–¥–¥–æ–Ω—ã –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –Ω–æ–≤—ã–µ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ Minecraft –¥–ª—è –º–æ–±–∏–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤, –∏–≥—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö –∫–æ–Ω—Å–æ–ª–µ–π –∏ Windows 10. –° –∏—Ö –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫–∏ —Å–º–æ–≥—É—Ç –ª–µ–≥–∫–æ –∏ –±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–æ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω—è—Ç—å –≤–Ω–µ—à–Ω–∏–π –≤–∏–¥. 
Just curious. Will Minecraft Windows 10 edition always be separate from Minecraft PC (Java) edition? Are they planning to eventually get rid of the Java version and strictly work with the Windows 10 edition? Will Windows 10 edition ever catch up with the content of the Java version? With the release of realms on W10/PE and being able to play on your realms using either Windows 10 or Mobile (and eventually Console), My wife and I have made the jump from the Java version to Windows 10 edition. –í—Å–µ–º –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç! –°–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è —Ö–æ—á—É –ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º–∏—Ç—å –í–∞—Å —Å —Å–∞–º—ã–º –Ω–æ–≤—ã–º Minecraft pe 0.14.0 –Ω–∞ windows phone! –ú–∞–π–Ω–∫—Ä–∞—Ñ—Ç - –∏–≥—Ä–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –ø–æ–∫–æ—Ä–∏–ª–∞ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö –∏ —É–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–±–µ –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ –¥–æ–ª–≥–∏–µ –≥–æ–¥—ã. 1- Is there a game controller for PC that would be similar to the XBOX 360/Chatpad combo, or an aftermarket 360 Chatpad that will work on PC?

Contrary to the rumors about Microsoft abandoning Minecraft app for Windows Phone users, the company today launched Minecraft Pocket Edition for Windows 10 Mobile with many new features and improvements. My husband and I haven't had a computer in about 2-3 years and we have been working on mobile since. Minecraft PE doesn't compare and I don't like playing it on console. Fortunately after paying off some debts we were able to get parts to build our own PCs. We are still waiting on some parts and in the meantime we are deciding on which OS we want to install.

Currently. it‚Äôs very complicated to share worlds between Pocket Edition devices. It may be technically possible, but it seems needlessly hard compared to the relative easiness of PC map downloading and the simplicity of how these devices can share other files. My suggestion is a tool contained within the MCPE and Windows 10 editions that would allow for easy world importing and exporting. This would also use a new type of compressed world file to allow the functionality.
